In this lab, we will explore the Risk Management Framework through stress test scenario visualization.
This application provides an interactive platform to understand and visualize the potential impact of various stress test scenarios on a firm's financial resources.
The primary objective is to enhance comprehension of how correlated threats can simultaneously affect multiple portfolios and processes.

We will simulate and visualize the outcomes of different stress test types: Sensitivity, Scenario, and Firm-Wide stress testing.
We will facilitate an understanding of the relationship between economic and market parameters and their ripple effects on financial metrics.
We will clearly present estimated impacts on crucial financial components such as income, costs, market risk losses, counterparty losses, credit losses, liquidity, provisions, reserves, and operational losses.
We will offer interactive visualizations that illustrate financial trajectories under stress, correlations between impact metrics, and aggregated comparisons of losses.
