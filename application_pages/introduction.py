    This lab explores the crucial role of risk-sensitive pricing in financial transactions, focusing on loans.  It aims to provide a practical understanding of how pricing strategies impact portfolio profitability and risk profiles.

    **Learning Objectives:**

    *   Understand the components of risk-based pricing: income, funding costs, operating costs, and expected loss.
    *   Learn to calculate and apply the Risk-Adjusted Return on Risk-Adjusted Capital (RARORAC) metric.
    *   Recognize the importance of economic capital as a buffer against unexpected losses.
    *   Gain insight into how sales behavior and pricing policy shape portfolio risk and profitability.

    We will use synthetic data and interactive simulations to demonstrate these concepts.  The following pages will guide you through the simulation and analysis process.
